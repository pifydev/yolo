/**
 * Consent for project-supplied files that pi does not know about.
 *
 * `ctx.isProjectTrusted()` looked like the right gate, and for pi's own
 * project resources it is. But pi only *asks* about trust when the repository
 * ships one of the things pi itself loads — `.pi/settings.json`,
 * `.pi/extensions`, `.pi/skills`, `.pi/prompts`, `.pi/themes`, `SYSTEM.md`,
 * `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. A repository carrying only a repository carrying only its own extension config
 * triggers no prompt at all, and `isProjectTrusted()` then returns true by
 * default. Measured, not assumed: a repo whose only pi file was
 * `.pi/agents/reviewer.md` reported `isProjectTrusted=true`, while the same repo
 * with a `.pi/skills` directory reported false.
 *
 * So a file this extension invented needs consent this extension asks for. pi
 * saying no is still final — this can only ever be a second gate, never a way
 * around the first.
